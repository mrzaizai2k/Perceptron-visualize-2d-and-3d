# Perceptron-visualize-2d-and-3d
Here I create a file that using perceptron to classify linearly separable dataset on 2d and 3d space

You can find my kaggle notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/bomaich/perceptron-visualize#PERCEPTRON) for more information

You can you file '.py' to visualize it
or file 'perceptron-visualize.ipynb' on google colab, jupyter notebook or kaggle
